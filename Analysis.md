# Design

## Algorithms

Its not just making a game that goes into designing software, its creating the underlying framework that's also important.
Below is a simple diagram of the game and its workings.

The process can be seperated into 3 main sections, input, update and draw (or poll, tick, renderer). Layer out like this is the best design for building any application, as all of the inputs are handled first, then any game logic happens, then its drawn to the screen.
This is a process that I will follow when creating future applications. Breaking this down further unto routines:

> ### Poll inputs
> - The game logic class will poll the input manager
> - It recursively goes through all the control interfaces, and checks to see if any of the key binds are pressed or held
> - If any of those key binds are held or down, it will call the subroutine in the interface

> ### Game tick
> - Check to see if a window is currently being displayed DO
> > - Poll menu manager
> > - Get the currently displayed menu
> > - Run logic for that menu
>
> - Check to see if Escape is pressed
> > - Activate pause screen
>
> - Poll the physics manager
> > - Run through all registered physics objects
> > - Poll physics for object
>
> - Poll camera controller
> - Update camera position based on player position
> - Times numbers by the previous value times a ratio of camera smoothness

> ### Draw Elements
> - Start 2D mode
> - Tick renderer
> > - Draw background using registered renderers
> > - Draw Elements using registered renderers

### Physics

Physics and something for every good side scroller has so I will be implementing it in my game. Physics are important because there needs to be a way for things to move around on the screen and interact with each other. So creating a working physics manager along with physics objects will be something I'm going to do.

> #### Physics manager
>
> Firstly, I need to make physics manager, so I can register physical objects and have a game update of every frame.
> Then I will need physics objects so that the physics manager has something to keep track of.

#### The basic physics methods are as follows

> ##### Velocity base
> We need to create a class that contains a position, dimension and physics properties, such as hasGravity, hasCollision and isEnabled.
> Now we have a base class with properties that we can manipulate so that things can move around the screen.

> ##### Velocity changes
>
> We will define a function so we can change the velocity of a game object. And then will check to see if the added velocity plus the existing velocity of the game object is greater than the max velocity defined the physics constants.
> If the velocity will be greater than max velocity zone, it will find the difference between the added velocity and the max velocity and set that difference as velocity change.
> Otherwise it will add the velocity to the Objects, current velocity and update. The velocity changed very true, so that any changes calculated, when the frame updates will be added.
> This is necessary, so that objects can have and receive new velocity, depending on how to use it interact with the game.

> ##### Global physics
>
> Firstly, we need to check to see if the object has gravity. If the object does have gravity and isn't on the ground, then we will add the gravity velocity to the object, moving it down.
> Secondly, we need to check if the player's foot Y value is equal to the game floor height. If so, cancel the object, Y velocity.
> If the first case isn't true, then we need to check for a second case. This check will be, checking to see if players foot Y position plus the velocity for the current frame will be greater than or equal to the floor height. If so, set the players y velocity to 0.
> If none of these cases are true, we can set the on-floor variable to false, as the player will not be on the floor.
> Please note that there should be a check implemented to see if the player goes out of bounds on the Y axis, if so, reset the players position, so that they never end up below the floor and fall infinitely.
> Next, we need to check if the player is on the floor, if so, then we need to calculate the X axis friction loss so that the player slows down when in contact with the floor. We will find this out with the following equation `if (!velocityChanged) frictionLossX = (velocity.x / MaxAccelerationSpeed) * Friction;`
> Using the same calculation, we then calculate the air resistance loss and subtract that from the players velocity for both axis.
> Lastly, we want to implement some soft limits to the players velocity so that they don't infinitely increase.
> And since the physics system will be using floats. We will implement a soft minimum value so that when the players velocity reaches less than or equal to 0.05 it will just equal zero.

> ##### Collision detection
> Firstly, we will implement an algorithm to check to see if the players position is in the range of a game object. This range will be 1+ the maximum velocity so that the player cannot clip inside of the object if the velocity is greater than a given range.
> Once we have this algorithm, we can perform and check on the objects in the level, to see which ones are closest to the player.
> Once we've acquired this list of objects, we can then perform collision calculations to see whether the player will collide with said object.
>
> Firstly, we get the players bounds by adding or subtracting the players dimensions divided by two from the players position to find the bounding box of the player.
> For the actual collision detection, it will be largely similar to checking if the player is on the floor, we will check to see if the players x bounds plus the velocity for the given frame equal the collidable objects x bounds. If so, set the players X velocity to 0 to stop the player from moving further inside the object.
> If that case isn't true, then we need to check if the players X velocity plus the players expound lands inside a game object, if so, find the difference between the x bound and the colldable object. Then set the X velocity to that value.
> Then we repeat the same process for the white axis on any new game objects to calculate the Y collision.
> Lastly, we want to check if the player is fully inside a game object if so, move the player outside of the game object to stop any players from slipping inside the object.

Once all of this has been completed, we have finished of velocity detection for the current frame and can then display the result.
And that will largely be it for the algorithms in my project as the majority of the code runs for every frame and doesn't much to any calculation.

## GUI

The main design of my game will be largely based off Extreme Pamplona in the fact that.

> ![](https://i.imgur.com/wrErLGJ.png)
>
> This will be the design of the main game window. From the image above, the main gameplay window will be a foreground layer with obstacles, a player area layer where the camera follows the player, an area where the npc can enter the screen if it gets too close, a parallax background and a level asset layer where the level assets can be shown. There will also be 3 layers at the top where the the game will display various stats about the player, and a timer.

> ### Player Stat Layers
> - The player stats layer will be an area where the user can clearly see the stats of there player, such as cool-downs and jump stamina.
> - The player player upgrades layer will be where the players current power-ups and power-up cool-downs will be displayed.
> - There will also be a timer in he top center.

> ### Level Arena Layer & Floor Layer
> - This is where the sort of foreground of the background will move from right to left, displaying a levels progress with dynamic scenery.
> - I will either be using free online assets or generating my own.
> - The floor layer will also be moving right to left and will be dynamic to the level progress.

> ### Parallax background Layer
> - This will be where there will be a fake 3d parallax layer, that will trick the user into thinking they are moving across a 3d plane with a fixed camera angle.
> - I will either be creating or generating, or using free online sources for these layers.
> - They will move in the opposite direction with distance multipliers to create the illusion of 3d perspective.

> ### Enemy Layer
> - This will be where the enemy comes on the screen if it gets to close.
> - The enemy will be offscreen left when the player outruns it.

> ### Player Layer
> - This will be where the player will be displayed.
> - Will be able to move back and fourth with the camera following, with the background moving right to left.
> - The assets used for the player will be either made by me, or use free open source content.

## Main menu & Settings

>![](https://i.imgur.com/ooouZw7.png)
>![](https://i.imgur.com/lrLv5wB.png)
>
>These are the designs of the main menu and settings screens I want to implement. I will first mark them out with rectangles in the game engine and then add assets and textures later.

> ### Firstly the main menu screen
> - It will consists of a section for the title card where there will be a banner for the game, including its title. It will be positioned at the top left of the screen
> - Next there is the buttons area. There will be a play button that will take the player to the Level select screen. There will also be a button to take the user to the Player stats screen. Then there will be a button to take the user to the settings menu, and lastly a quit button.
> - The background section is where there will be animated transition images of the game, to keep the player engaged with the game straight from boot.
> - Finally there will be a game version information area that will display the current game build version and engine version etc.

> ### Secondly the settings screen
> - It will consist of a menu with different category selectors to change what category of setting you wish to change
> - In the sub categories there will be a variety of sliders, buttons, input boxes, lists etc. to change settings of the game.
> - There will be an apply, reset and close button at the bottom left.
> - There may also be a area at the bottom of the screen that displays some more information about the game version.

## Misc screens

> #### Stats screen (and maybe a leaderboard)
> - I would like to impliment a stats screen so that the player can see what levels they have completed, there time record, there high score and other various stats.
> - I would like to have them sync up with a online database but may not get round to that.

> #### Pause menu
> - A traditional pause menu that shows: resume, restart, game settings and main menu.
> - It will also show current score, current time and pause the game.

And that's largely it, this is where I will be focusing on these sections of the game, adding features where I see fit.

## Structure Diagrams

![Flow diagram](https://i.imgur.com/kRE7aZK.png)

As stated in the algorithm section, it is important to design a framework that you can create your game on top of us, just creating a game using draw instructions and inputs can be a very inefficient and messy.
Above is the structure diagram for the underlying framework that I have built for my game. As you can see, it's broken into three main parts, poll, update, draw, And this is important to maintain this main flow as any and all updates need to happen before calculations happen and finally it should be drawn to the screen.

Another notable element of my project would be the use of managers and child objects. I use managers everywhere in my project, and the managers are a way to register store update and on register elements when they are needed.
Below is a flow diagram, representing all of the managers in my game.

![](https://i.imgur.com/A3CMzvw.png)
As you can see from the diagram above, it is easy for me at any point to add any kind of elements to my game at any point.

And this is largely it for the flow diagrams of my game. As you can see everything is laid out sensibly, and it is easy to implement new features using my framework.

## Subroutine Exp

In my game there are a variety of subroutines that are used to make the game work. I will be going over the main ones here.

### Game

The first of which being the main `Game.cs` file. This is the main class that is run when the game is started. It is responsible for creating the window, and running the main game loop.

```cs
    // Tick() function in all files executes the main logic for that frame
    procedure Tick():
    
        if Closed: return // If the window is closed, return
        
        if MenuManager.IsScreenActive(): MenuManager.Tick()
        
        if IsKeyPressed(KEY_ESCAPE): // If escape is pressed, pause the game
            Pause()
            MenuManager.SetActiveWindow(PauseMenuScreen.UiId)
            return
        endif
            
      
        

        if !IsRunning: return // If the game is not running, dont run the game logic
        
        PhysicsManager.Tick()
        CameraController.Tick()
    endprocedure
    
```

This is the main game loop, and it is responsible for running the main logic for the game. It first checks to see if the game is running, and if it is, it will run the physics manager and the camera controller. The physics manager is responsible for running the physics for all of the physics objects, and the camera controller is responsible for moving the camera to follow the player.

The next subroutines are responsible for enabling and disabling the game along with the currently active and inactive renderers.

```cs 
    // Begin function that is called after the level loads
    procedure Run():
    
        LoadLevel()

        Player = new Player(new Vector2(0, FloorHeight - 100)) // Create a new player object
        PhysicsManager.RegisterObject(Player) // Register the player with the physics manager

        RenderElements() // Render all of the game elements
        
        Timer.Start() // Start the game timer
        IsRunning = true // Set the game to running
    endprocedure

    // Stop function that is called when the game is stopped
    procedure Stop():
    
        IsRunning = false // Set the game to not running
        PhysicsManager.Stop() // Stop the physics manager
    
        Unrender() // Unrender all of the game elements
        
        Player = null // Set the player to null
        
        Timer.Reset() // Reset the game timer
    endprocedure

    // Load renderers 
    procedure RenderElements():
    
        RenderManager.RenderPlayer(Player) // Render the player
        RenderManager.RenderGameElement(ObjectRenderer) // Render all the gae objects
        RenderManager.RenderGameElement(new FloorRenderer(this)) // Render the floor
        RenderManager.RenderGameElement(PowerUpRenderer) // Render the powerups
     
        CameraController.Init() // Initialise the camera controller, so that it can follow the player
        BackgroundRenderer.IsEnabled = true // Enable the background renderer
        HudRenderer.IsEnabled = true // Enable the hud renderer
        TimerRenderer.IsEnabled = true // Enable the timer renderer
    endprocedure
    
    // Unload renderers
    procedure Unrender():
    
        RenderManager.UnRenderGameElement(new FloorRenderer(this)) // Unrender the floor
        if Player != null: RenderManager.UnrenderPlayer(Player) // Unrender the player
        RenderManager.UnRenderGameElement(ObjectRenderer) // Unrender all of the game objects
        RenderManager.UnRenderGameElement(PowerUpRenderer) // Unrender the powerups

        BackgroundRenderer.IsEnabled = false // Disable the background renderer
        HudRenderer.IsEnabled = false // Disable the hud renderer
        TextRenderer.IsEnabled = false // Disable the text renderer
        TimerRenderer.IsEnabled = false // Disable the timer renderer
        
    endprocedure

    // Remove all level data and reset the game
    procedure Reset():
    
        Stop()
        LoadLevel()
        Run()
    endprocedure
```

As you can see, the `Run()` function is responsible for loading the level, and then registering the player with the physics manager. It then renders all of the game elements, and starts the game timer.
And the stop function is responsible for stopping the game, and unrendering all of the game elements.

### Menus

The next subroutines are the menu subroutines. These are responsible for loading and unloading the menus, and running the logic for the menus.

```cs
    procedure RegisterMenu(int id, Window menu):
    
        _windows.Add(id, menu) // Add the menu to the windows dictionary
        
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterUiRenderer(menu.Renderer) // Register the menu renderer with the renderer
    endprocedure
    

    procedure SetActiveWindow(int id):
    
        DisableAll() // Disable all of the windows
        CurrentWindow = id // Set the current window to the given id
        window = _windows[CurrentWindow] // Get the current window
        
        if window == null: return
        
        window.OnDisplay() // Run the on display function for the window to initialise the window
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.EnableRenderer(window.Renderer.Identifier) // Enable the renderer for the window
    endprocedure
   
        
    procedure Tick():
    
        if !IsScreenActive(): return; // If there is no active screen, return
        window = _windows[CurrentWindow] // Get the current window
        window?.Tick(); // Run the logic for the window
    endprocedure
```

From the code above you can see that the `SetActiveWindow()` function is responsible for setting the active window, and disabling all of the other windows. It then gets the current window, and runs the `OnDisplay()` function for that window. It then enables the renderer for that window.
Tick is responsible for running the logic for the current window.
And RegisterMenu is responsible for registering the menu with the menu manager.
Inside the a window class will be subroutines responsible for registering the buttons and inputs for that window.

```cs
    procedure OnDisplay():
    
        RegisterButtons();
        RegisterInputs();
        
    endprocedure
```

Subroutines responsible for running the logic for the menu.

```cs
    procedure Tick():
    
        for pair in buttons:
        
            Button? clicked = pair.Value
            if clicked == null: continue

            if clicked.IsClicked(): Select(pair.Key)
            
        endfor
    endprocedure     
```

And subroutines responsible for registering the buttons and inputs for that window.

```cs
    procedure RegisterButtons()
    
        Buttons.Add("Play", new Button(new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 50), "Play", Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK));
        Buttons.Add("Settings", new Button(new Rectangle(100, 200, 200, 50), "Settings", Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK));
        Buttons.Add("Quit", new Button(new Rectangle(100, 300, 200, 50), "Quit", Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK));
    endprocedure
```

### Testing the subroutines

Due to the nature of my programming methodology I will have to test the subroutines as I go along. I will be testing the subroutines by running the game and seeing if the subroutines work as expected. I will also be using the debugger to step through the code and see if the subroutines are working as expected.
As it is hard to test the subroutines without running the game, I will be testing them as I go along.

## Testing plan

## Usability Features

A clear usability feature is that it needs to be playable by any age of user, including interacting with the game, so I feel it is important to add clear user controls where necessary to guide the user in how to play the game.

Any text needs to be readable on the screen at any size so will aim to adapt different screen resolutions, and all game elements should be thoroughly visible at any scale.

![Mockup](https://i.imgur.com/EsG3Ub1.png)

As you can see from this mockup, the text will appear large in the buttons and will span 5 elements in the window height so everything is visible.

Playability is also important down to knowing what controls to use, so the bottom of the screen will show where the player controls will be.

I want to focus on the ability to navigate the levels easily, maybe introducing a level select carousel with screenshots of the levels to display what a level will be, including the level difficulty.

I want to also make it clear if the game is loading or saving to make sure that the user doesnt have to wait for program hangs and so they don't get confused between crashes and intended behaviour.

Having clear explanations for in game features will also be an important factor as some new players, not just to the game, but the gaming industry need to be able to understand game mechanics, controls, scoring schemes etc.

Another usability feature is having an obvious way to exit the game, so I will be adding a quit button to the main menu.

And lastly having a way to display the user what ui elements are interactable, so I will be adding a hover effect to the buttons, sliders and any other ui elements.



## Validation

A good example of input validation would be the ui elements, sadly for the the game engine I am using, the ui elements are not something you can just import, so I had to do a lot of trial and error to get the ui elements to work as expected.

For these I will be creating a base UI element class that contains some basic code to validate user inputs when interacting with the ui elements.

One instance of this is a button, there should be code to check if the mouse is over the button, and if the mouse is clicked, then the button should be clicked.

It may look something like this:

```csharp   
public bool IsClicked()
{
    return IsMouseOver() && InputManager.IsMousePressed(MouseButton.Left);
}

public virtual bool IsMouseOver()
{
    Vector2 mousePos = InputManager.GetMousePosition();
    return mousePos.X > Position.X && 
           mousePos.X < Position.X + Dimensions.X &&
           mousePos.Y > Position.Y &&
           mousePos.Y < Position.Y + Dimensions.Y;
}
```

Something like a slider would be a bit more complicated, as it would need to check if the mouse is over the slider, and if the mouse is pressed, then it should move the slider to the mouse position.
We also need to check weather the slide head is will be beyond the bounds of ui element and stop it if this occors.

It could look something like this:
```csharp
public override bool IsClicked()
{
    if (base.IsClicked() || (_held && Raylib.IsMouseButtonDown(MouseButton.MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT)))
    {
        _held = true;
        SliderOffset = Raylib.GetMouseX() * Loader.WindowManager.VirtualRatio - Position.GetX();
        
        if (SliderOffset < 0) SliderOffset = 0;
        if (SliderOffset > Dimensions.GetX()) SliderOffset = Dimensions.GetX();
    } else _held = false;
    
    return _held;
}
```
`_held` being our variable to detect if the slider is being held if the user is still clicking the element, but move their mouse beyond the limits of the slider.

As you can tell from the elements above I will have to do a lot of validation for the ui elements, and I will be doing this by running the game and seeing if the elements work as expected.

### Testing methods

After creating ui elements and other features in need to be tested I will have to run the game to make sure that they work as expected.
However just testing these elements on their own may be challenging as they may rely on other elements to work as expected, such as the menu classes to hold the elements.
I have created something similar to these in php using the same game engine, so I will be using that as a reference to see if the elements work as expected.
You can see them in [this section](#ui-elements).
I will be using iterative development to complete my game so I will be testing the elements as I go along.
This will be mentioned along side my main development in the [Development](#development) section.


# Development

## Underlying Framework

> #### A few notes
> - I am going to be creating my game using the object oriented programming method, this allows me to have many custom classes working together to achieve a human readable and maintainable structure to my programming, while also allowing me to create different elements of the game that all work together with minimal re-writes.
> - I will be using interfaces for any and all input logic, this reduces the number of selection statements and duplicated code.
> - Some options such as resolution and control schemes will be using structs, to reduce the amount of registered classes in the game.
> - I will be using a game engine called raylib, this is a c# game engine that allows me to create games in c# and have them run on any platform, including windows, mac and linux.
> - Due to time constraints I didn't have time to document the renderers, so have included a quick description of what each renderer class does.

### Underlying framework

Firstly I will be creating an underlying framework for my game to run on. This will consist of an input system for reading user inputs, an update system for executing game logic, and a draw loop to display the computed inputs, game logic, and elements to the screen.
This section will be largely based off of the framework I created in my mini-nea found [here](https://github.com/WolfDen133/MiniNEA).

#### Window Manager & Renderer

Firstly I will create a window manager that will be registered in the main class. This window manager will contain all the logic needed to register a window in the underlying operating system and allow me to start drawing elements.

It is important to note the different elements of this class such as VirtualRatio, screenspace camera, actual camera and source & destination rectangles, using the logic in the Draw subroutine, it will be able to draw things to a virtual canvas, while ignoring the actual resolution of the window.
This easily allows me to implement resolution scaling, so that users can choose between different resolutions in there play session.


Please note that we are using the class Renderer.cs as our render manager, so we can keep track of any and all registered renderers, and there current render state.
```csharp
using System.Numerics;
using Velocity.Window.Render;
using Raylib_cs;

namespace Velocity.Window;

public class WindowManager
{
    public const int Width = 1920;
    public const int Height = 1080;
        
    public Camera2D Camera;
    private Camera2D _screenSpaceCamera;
    public float VirtualRatio;

    private RenderTexture2D _target;
    private Rectangle _sourceRectangle;
    private Rectangle _destRectangle;
    
    // This is the procedure of creating a window and registering it in the operating system
    // It also creates a virtual canvas to draw to, so that we can scale the game to any resolution
    // It also creates a camera so that we can move the camera around the game world
    public void CreateWindow()
    {
        VirtualRatio = Width / Velocity.Settings.Resolution.X;
        _sourceRectangle = new Rectangle(0, 0, Width, -Height);
        _destRectangle = new Rectangle(-VirtualRatio, -VirtualRatio, Velocity.Settings.Resolution.X + VirtualRatio * 2, Velocity.Settings.Resolution.Y + VirtualRatio * 2);

        Raylib.InitWindow(
            (int)Velocity.Settings.Resolution.X,
            (int)Velocity.Settings.Resolution.Y,
            GameConst.Name
        ); 


        _target = Raylib.LoadRenderTexture(Width, Height);
        
        Raylib.SetExitKey(KeyboardKey.KEY_NULL);

        Raylib.SetTargetFPS(60);
        Renderer = new Renderer();
        Camera = new Camera2D();

        Camera.target = new Vector2(0, 0);
        Camera.offset = new Vector2(0, 0);
        Camera.rotation = 0.0f;
        Camera.zoom = 1.0f;

        _screenSpaceCamera = Camera;
    }
    
    
    // This is the procedure of applying any settings changes to the window
    // This includes resolution, fullscreen, and any other settings
    public void ApplySettingsChange()
    {
        if (!Raylib.IsWindowFullscreen() && Loader.Settings.FullScreen) Raylib.ToggleFullscreen();
        else if (Raylib.IsWindowFullscreen() && !Loader.Settings.FullScreen) Raylib.ToggleFullscreen();
        
        VirtualRatio = Width / Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].X;
        _destRectangle = new Rectangle(-VirtualRatio, -VirtualRatio, Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].X + VirtualRatio * 2, Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].Y + VirtualRatio * 2);

        Raylib.SetWindowSize((int)Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].X, (int)Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].Y);
    }

    // This is the main draw loop of the game, it will draw to a virtual canvas, and then draw that canvas to the screen
    // This allows us to scale the game to any resolution
    // It also allows us to use a camera to move around the game world
    public void DrawLoop()
    {
        while (!Raylib.WindowShouldClose()) 
        {
            Velocity.ControlManager.Tick(); // These are not implimented yet but will be used to update the control manager
            Velocity.Game.Tick(); // These are not implimented yet but will be used to update the game logic

            _screenSpaceCamera.target = Camera.target;

            Camera.target = _screenSpaceCamera.target;
            _screenSpaceCamera.target = Vector2.Subtract(Camera.target, Camera.target);
            _screenSpaceCamera.target.X *= VirtualRatio;
            _screenSpaceCamera.target.Y *= VirtualRatio;

            if (Velocity.Game.Closed) break; // To check if the game needs to be closed

            Raylib.BeginTextureMode(_target);

                Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientV(0, 0, Width, Height, new Color(0, 185, 230, 255), new Color(0, 200, 255, 255));

                Raylib.BeginMode2D(Camera);
                
                    Renderer.DrawGame();
                
                Raylib.EndMode2D();

                Renderer.DrawUi();
            
            Raylib.EndTextureMode();

            Raylib.BeginDrawing();

                Raylib.ClearBackground(Color.BLACK);
                Raylib.BeginMode2D(_screenSpaceCamera);
                
                Raylib.DrawTexturePro(_target.texture, _sourceRectangle, _destRectangle, new Vector2(), 0, Color.WHITE);
                Raylib.EndMode2D(); 
            Raylib.EndDrawing();
        }
        
        Raylib.CloseWindow();
    }
    
    public Renderer Renderer { get; set; }
```

> One notable error that I encoutered when creating the window manager was that the image that was drawn to the screen was flipped, this was because of the way that raylib draws images to the screen, and the way that we are handleing multiple resolutions. To fix this I had to flip the image on the y axis using a negated Virtual Ratio in the line:
>
> `_destRectangle = new Rectangle(-VirtualRatio, -VirtualRatio, Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].X + VirtualRatio * 2, Settings.Resolutions[Loader.Settings.Resolution].Y + VirtualRatio * 2);`
> Using a negated virtual ratio, we can flip the image on the y axis, and draw it to the screen correctly.

#### Renderer and sub-renderers

Next we are going to create a renderer and sub-renderers so that we can assign a renderer to game elements, giving them a customizable renderer for any kind of display that we want.

The `Renderer.cs` file will be considered our master render manager, giving the game to have a way to register, keep track of and display elements of the game.

What's important to note is that there are 3/4 different types of sub-renderers:
- Background renderer: Render any background elements, these do not effect the element renderers and will be drawn first to the canvas
- Element renderer: Render elements in the canvas displayed in the game
- UI Renderer: Render all ui elements to the window (not canvas) so that they have a constant position in the window
- (Conditional renderer: Render elements when and only when the renderer has been called by a parent renderer [these could be considered as a child renderer])

```csharp
using Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;
using Raylib_cs;

namespace Velocity.Window.Render;

public class Renderer
{
    private Dictionary<string, ElementRenderer?> _elementRenderers = new (); 
    private Dictionary<string, UiRenderer> _uiRenderers = new ();
    private Dictionary<string, BackgroundRenderer> _backgroundRenderers = new();

    // Register an in-game element's renderer
    public void RegisterElementRenderer(ElementRenderer? element)
    {
        _elementRenderers.Add(element.Identifier, element);
    }
    
    // Register a screen-space element's renderer
    public void RegisterUiRenderer(UiRenderer element)
    {
        _uiRenderers.Add(element.Identifier, element);
        Console.WriteLine("Registered ui renderer: " + element.Identifier);
    }

    // Register an background element's renderer
    public void RegisterBackgroundRenderer(BackgroundRenderer renderer)
    {
        _backgroundRenderers.Add(renderer.Identifier, renderer);
    }

    // Unregister a renderer
    public void UnregisterRenderer(string id)
    {
        _elementRenderers.TryGetValue(id, out ElementRenderer? elementRenderer);
        _uiRenderers.TryGetValue(id, out UiRenderer? uiRenderer);

        if (elementRenderer != null)
        {
            _elementRenderers.Remove(id);
            return;
        }

        if (uiRenderer != null)
        {
            _uiRenderers.Remove(id);
            return;
        }
    }

    // Enable a renderer
    public void EnableRenderer(string id)
    {
        _elementRenderers.TryGetValue(id, out ElementRenderer? elementRenderer);

        _uiRenderers.TryGetValue(id, out UiRenderer? uiRenderer);

        elementRenderer?.Enable();
        uiRenderer?.Enable();
    }

    // Disable a renderer
    public void DisableRenderer (string id)
    {
        _elementRenderers.TryGetValue(id, out ElementRenderer? elementRenderer);

        _uiRenderers.TryGetValue(id, out UiRenderer? uiRenderer);

        elementRenderer?.Disable();
        uiRenderer?.Disable();
    }

    // Draw the screen-space elements
    public void DrawUi()
    {
        foreach (KeyValuePair<string, UiRenderer> renderer in _uiRenderers)
        {
            if (renderer.Value.IsEnabled)
            {
                renderer.Value.Draw();
            }
        }
    }

    // Draw the game on the canvas
    public void DrawGame()
    {
        foreach (var renderer in _backgroundRenderers)
        {
            if (renderer.Value.IsEnabled) renderer.Value.Draw();
        }

        foreach (KeyValuePair<string, ElementRenderer?> renderer in _elementRenderers)
        {
            if (renderer.Value.IsEnabled) renderer.Value.Draw();
        }
    }
}
```

The `SimpleRenderer.cs` class will be are base to create our other renderers off of.

```csharp
namespace Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;

// Parent of all the renderers
public class SimpleRenderer
{
    public bool IsEnabled;
    
    public string Identifier { get; set; }

    public SimpleRenderer(string identifier)
    {
        Identifier = identifier;
    }
    
    public void Enable()
    {
        IsEnabled = true;
    }

    public void Disable()
    {
        IsEnabled = false;
    }
    public virtual void Draw () {}
}
```

And below will be all of our different renderers

```csharp
namespace Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;

// Main renderer for rendering game elements (elements & player)
public class ElementRenderer : SimpleRenderer
{
    public ElementRenderer(string identifier, bool isEnabled = true) : base(identifier)
    {
        IsEnabled = isEnabled;
    }
}
```

```csharp
namespace Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;

public class BackgroundRenderer : UiRenderer
{
    public BackgroundRenderer(string id, bool isEnabled = true) : base(id)
    {
        IsEnabled = isEnabled;
    }
}
```

```csharp
namespace Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;

// Renderer that renders all ui layer elements, (always drawn last)
public class UiRenderer : SimpleRenderer
{
    public UiRenderer(string identifier, bool isEnabled = true) : base(identifier)
    {
        IsEnabled = isEnabled;
    }
}
```

```csharp
namespace Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;

// Renderer that only draws when the logic calls it
public abstract class ConditionalRenderer : UiRenderer
{
    public ConditionalRenderer(string id) : base(id) {}
    
    public new virtual void Draw()
    { }
}
```

Now there is one more renderer that is spasificlly for UI elements, that is used to render a UI element to the screen, and to draw the hover animation so that the user knows that they can interact with the element.
For this class we need to add one more function that is dedicated for drawing the animation and adjusting the alpha value so that it changes over time.
And another function to actually change the colors for the element.

```csharp

    public UiElement Parent;
    public Color BgColor { get; set; }
    public Color InternalBg;
    public Color BorderColor { get; set; }
    public Color InternalBorder;

    private int _aStep = 0;
    private const int MaxStep = 10;
    private const int GlowRadius = 8;

    protected AnimatableRenderer (UiElement parent, string identifier, Color? bgColor = null, Color? borderColor = null) : base(identifier)
    {
        Parent = parent;
        
        BgColor = bgColor ?? new Color(40, 40, 40, 255);
        BorderColor = borderColor ?? Color.WHITE;
        UpdateColors();
    }

    public void DrawAnimation()
    {
        if (Parent.IsMouseOver() && _aStep < MaxStep) _aStep++;
        else if (!(Parent.IsMouseOver()) && _aStep > 0) _aStep--;

        double a = Convert.ToDouble(_aStep) / MaxStep;
        
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientH((int)Parent.Position.X- GlowRadius, (int)Parent.Position.Y, 8, (int)Parent.Dimensions.Y, new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientH((int)Parent.Position.X + (int)Parent.Dimensions.X, (int)Parent.Position.Y, 8, (int)Parent.Dimensions.Y, new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientV((int)Parent.Position.X, (int)Parent.Position.Y- GlowRadius, (int)Parent.Dimensions.X, 8, new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientV((int)Parent.Position.X, (int)Parent.Position.Y + (int)Parent.Dimensions.Y, (int)Parent.Dimensions.X, 8, new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientEx(new Rectangle((int)Parent.Position.X- GlowRadius, (int)Parent.Position.Y- GlowRadius, GlowRadius, GlowRadius), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)), new Color(255, 255, 255, 0));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientEx(new Rectangle((int)Parent.Position.X + (int)Parent.Dimensions.X, (int)Parent.Position.Y- GlowRadius, GlowRadius, GlowRadius), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(255, 255, 255, 0));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientEx(new Rectangle((int)Parent.Position.X- GlowRadius, (int)Parent.Position.Y + (int)Parent.Dimensions.Y, GlowRadius, GlowRadius), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(255, 255, 255, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)));
        Raylib.DrawRectangleGradientEx(new Rectangle((int)Parent.Position.X + (int)Parent.Dimensions.X, (int)Parent.Position.Y + (int)Parent.Dimensions.Y, GlowRadius, GlowRadius), new Color(200, 200, 200, Convert.ToInt16(255 * a)), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(200, 200, 200, 0), new Color(255, 255, 255, 0));
        
        UpdateColors(a);
    }

    private void UpdateColors(double multiplier = 0)
    {
        InternalBg = BgColor with { a = Convert.ToByte(200 + 50 * multiplier) };
        InternalBorder = BorderColor with { a = Convert.ToByte(200 + 50 * multiplier) };
    }
```

#### Input manager & input elements

Next we are going to create an input manager that will be registered in the main class. This input manager will contain all the logic needed to register an input controller and allow me to start reading inputs.
Then we will make a few input elements that will be used to read inputs from the user.
Using a keybind class created in the same file as control manager will give me read and write access to spasific keys, therefor allowing me to create a control screen where you can reassign key binds for spasific actions.
Finally create a controller class that other classes can extend to create there own input controllers with custom logic for that use case.

```csharp
using Raylib_cs;
using Velocity.Utils;

namespace Velocity.Input;

public class ControlManager
{
    // List of the registered controllers
    private List<IControllable> _controllers = new();

    // Register a controller
    public void RegisterController(IControllable controller)
    {
        _controllers.Add(controller);
    }

    
    // Unregister a controller
    public void UnRegisterController(IControllable controller)
    {
        _controllers.Remove(controller);
    }

    // Tick the controllers
    public void Tick()
    {
        foreach (var controller in _controllers.ToList())
        {
            if (Raylib.IsKeyPressed(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.Interact)) controller.OnInteract();
            if (Raylib.IsKeyDown(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.Left)) controller.OnLeft(); 
            if (Raylib.IsKeyDown(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.Right)) controller.OnRight();
            if (Raylib.IsKeyPressed(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.Jump)) controller.OnJump();
            if (Raylib.IsKeyDown(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.Down)) controller.OnDown();
            if (Raylib.IsKeyDown(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.ZoomIn)) controller.OnZoomIn();
            if (Raylib.IsKeyDown(Loader.Settings.Keybinds.ZoomOut)) controller.OnZoomOut();
        }
    }
}

public class Keybinds : IEquatable<Keybinds>
{
    // Default keybinds
    public KeyboardKey Interact = KeyboardKey.KEY_E;
    public KeyboardKey Left = KeyboardKey.KEY_A;
    public KeyboardKey Right = KeyboardKey.KEY_D;
    public KeyboardKey Jump = KeyboardKey.KEY_SPACE;
    public KeyboardKey Down = KeyboardKey.KEY_S;
    public KeyboardKey ZoomIn = KeyboardKey.KEY_EQUAL;
    public KeyboardKey ZoomOut = KeyboardKey.KEY_MINUS;

    // Convert a keybind to its action id
    public enum ActionId
    {
        Interact = 0,
        Left = 1,
        Right = 2,
        Jump = 3,
        Down = 4,
        ZoomIn = 5,
        ZoomOut = 6
    }

    // Convert an action id to its string value for display
    public static string IdToString(ActionId id)
    {
        switch (id)
        {
            case ActionId.Interact: return ActionNames[0];
            case ActionId.Left: return ActionNames[1];
            case ActionId.Right: return ActionNames[2];
            case ActionId.Jump: return ActionNames[3];
            case ActionId.Down: return ActionNames[4];
            case ActionId.ZoomIn: return ActionNames[5];
            case ActionId.ZoomOut: return ActionNames[6];
            default: return "-";
        }
    }
    
    // Check to see if a key is taken
    public bool IsKeyTaken(KeyboardKey key)
    {
        return Interact == key || Left == key || Right == key || Jump == key || Down == key || ZoomIn == key || ZoomOut == key;
    }

    // Internal list of action names
    private static readonly string[] ActionNames = 
    {
        "Interact",
        "Left",
        "Right",
        "Jump",
        "Down",
        "ZoomIn",
        "ZoomOut"
    };
    
    public bool Equals(Keybinds? other)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, other)) return false;
        return Interact == other.Interact && Left == other.Left && Right == other.Right && Jump == other.Jump && Down == other.Down && ZoomIn == other.ZoomIn && ZoomOut == other.ZoomOut;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, obj)) return false;
        // if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) return true;
        if (obj.GetType() != this.GetType()) return false;
        return Equals((Keybinds)obj);
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine((int)Interact, (int)Left, (int)Right, (int)Jump, (int)Down, (int)ZoomIn, (int)ZoomOut);
    }
}
```
And then we will define our controller interface

```csharp
    namespace Velocity.Input;

public interface IControllable
{
    // Interact with the object
    public void OnInteract()
    {}
    
    // Move left
    public void OnLeft ()
    {}
    
    // Move right
    public void OnRight ()
    {}

    // Jump
    public void OnJump ()
    {}
    
    // Move down: TODO: use this for crouching
    public void OnDown ()
    {}

    // Zoom the camera in
    public void OnZoomIn()
    { }
     
    // Zoom the camera out
    public void OnZoomOut()
    {}
}
```

This allows us to create a controller class that other classes can implement to create there own input controllers with custom logic.

### Main Loader

Lastly I will be creating a main loader class to register all of our managers, so that our program can keep track, and have easy access to all of the required classes.
This file will serve as our entry point in our program, so that any future-defined classes have access to the static properties of this class.
It will also be where we call all of our run functions to initalise and run the logic.
I will also be defining a function that will update the actual window properties and sound levels so we can call a simple function to apply the users selected settings.
Lastly it will contain the necessary logic to close the window, and save all the user data, such as settings, best times etc.

```csharp
using Velocity.Asset;
using Velocity.Game.Statistics;
using Velocity.Sound;
using Velocity.Input;
using Velocity.Ui.Screens;
using Velocity.Window;

namespace Velocity
{
    public class Loader
    {
        // Entry point
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Load settings
            Settings = new Settings();
            Settings.Load();
            
            // Initialisation
            
            ControlManager = new ControlManager();
            WindowManager = new WindowManager();
            WindowManager.CreateWindow();
            
            AssetManager = new AssetManager(); // For use later
            AudioManager = new AudioManager(); // For use later
            
            Game = new Game.Game(); // For later use
            Game.MenuManager.RegisterMenus(); // Menus for later use
            Game.MenuManager.SetActiveWindow(MainMenuScreen.UiId); // Menus for later use
            
            StatisticManager.Load();
            ApplySettings();
            
            // Begin game logic
            WindowManager.DrawLoop();
            
            // After window has closed
            StatisticManager.Save();
            Settings.Save();
        }
        
        // Apply the user selected settings
        private static void ApplySettings()
        {
            WindowManager.ApplySettingsChange();
            
            AudioManager.UpdateVolume();
            
            AudioManager.UpdateGameVolume();
            AudioManager.UpdatePlayerVolume();
            AudioManager.UpdateUiVolume();
        }

        // To stop the game and close the window
        public static void Close()
        {
            Game.Closed = true;
            Settings.Save();
            StatisticManager.Save();
        }
        
        
        public static WindowManager WindowManager
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public static Game.Game Game // Not implemented yet (Here for later use)
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
        
        public static Settings Settings // Not implemented yet (Here for later use)
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public static ControlManager ControlManager 
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public static AssetManager AssetManager // Not implemented yet (Here for later use)
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
        
        public static AudioManager AudioManager // Not implemented yet (Here for later use)
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
    }
}
```

And this defines our underlying framework, with this we can build other classes built from our framework dedicated to, drawing things to the screen, handling player inputs, and handling our game logic.

After these classes have been created, we can perform our first test.
Linking back to our [Testing plan, test 1](#testing-plan), we can use this test to validate weather our system is working.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Op02MOT.png)

And as we can see from the image above, we have a working window, ready for the logic to be added for the next step.

## Base game, Settings and Menus

Now we have our underlying framework we can begin to build the basic structures for our main game logic, the settings and preferences, and menus that will be displayed to the user.
To begin we will be going into these sections and building our classes with our required properties and functions to build a functioning game.

### Render Manager & Base Game

#### RenderManager
Firstly we will be creating a render manager class dedicated as an interface between our game file and our renderer, build as a translater so we can register renderers to the screen, these will contain render and unrender functions for all of the different renderable types.
It will also contain the method for registering any default renderers such as the DebugRenderer which is defined below, which will be added to when we come to creating the player renderer.

```csharp
using Velocity.Ui.Overlay.Render;
using Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;

namespace Velocity.Game;

public class RenderManager
{
    public RenderManager()
    {
        RegisterDefault();
    }

    /**
     * Register default renderers
     */
    private void RegisterDefault() 
    {
        if (GameConst.Debug) Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterUiRenderer(new DebugRenderer());
    }
    
    /**
     * Render the player object
     */
    public void RenderPlayer(Player.Player player)
    {
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterElementRenderer(player.Renderer);
    }

    /*
     * Unused: Unrender the player object
     */
    public void UnrenderPlayer(Player.Player player)
    {
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.UnregisterRenderer(player.Renderer.Identifier);
    }

    /**
     * Render a static ui element
     */
    public void RenderUiElement(UiRenderer renderer)
    {
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterUiRenderer(renderer);
    }

    /**
     * Render a game object renderer
     */
    public void RenderGameElement(ElementRenderer renderer)
    {
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterElementRenderer(renderer);
    }

    /**
     * Render a dynamic background object renderer
     */
    public void RenderBackgroundElement(BackgroundRenderer renderer)
    {
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterBackgroundRenderer(renderer);
    }

    /**
     * Unrender any of these object's renderers
     */
    public void UnRenderGameElement(ElementRenderer renderer)
    {
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.UnregisterRenderer(renderer.Identifier);
    }
}
```

#### Debug renderer:

For later use just to show basic information about the game.

```csharp
using Velocity.Window.Render.Renderers;
using Raylib_cs;

namespace Velocity.Ui.Overlay.Render;

public class DebugRenderer : UiRenderer
{
    public DebugRenderer () : base("Velocity:overlay.debug") {}

    public override void Draw()
    {
        // if (!y.Velocity.IsRunning || Velocity.Player == null) return;

        Raylib.DrawText(
            "Velocity: " + "\n" +
            " FPS: " + Raylib.GetFPS() + "\n" +
            " Delta: " + Raylib.GetFrameTime() + "\n" +
            "\n\n" /*+
            "PLAYER: \n Position: " + Velocity.Player.Position.X + ", " + Velocity.Player.Position.Y + "\n" + 
            " Velocity: " + Velocity.Player.Controller._velocity.X + " " + Velocity.Player.Controller._velocity.Y + "\n" +
            " OnPlatform: " + (Velocity.Player.Controller.OnGround ? "true" : "false") + "\n"
            */, 0, 0, 24, Color.WHITE);
    }
}
```

### Base Game

Now our base game file will be where all our main game will be run from, it will contain functions such as `run()` and `stop()` to begin and end our game, and will contain the main loop run for every frame of the games logic loop.
As this file is one of the most commonly accessed files it contains definitions that we have not looked at yet, but these are the classes referenced later in the development section.
The point of the file being the main game components to control all the game functions.

        if (Player.Position.X < -(Velocity.Level.Level.LevelWidth / 2 + 3) * 200) Player.Velocity.X = -PhysicsConst.MaxAcceleration;

    }
    
}


```

As you can see there are many functions of this class that are responsible for handling all of the main components of the game.

### Settings

Next we will need to create a settings class so that we can have values to set and read from when changing the games in-game preferences, such as camera smoothness or game volume.
Our settings file will contain all our main variables in relation to actual configuration such as resolution, controls etc. It will be defined in our main class, and be accessible to everything inside the program code.
We will do this by defining our settings property as static therefor it can be assessed from the class' static instance.
We will also define our DefaultSettings in a struct so we have an easy way to apply the default settings, and will create a function to do just that.
Lastly we will define our settings file handler, so we can write and read from a file, this enables disk saving so that the chosen preferences will be saved across game restarts.
I will include functions to save and load from this file handler so it operates correctly, and call the load and save of the file, before and after game load and close respectively.
```csharp
using System.Globalization;
using System.Numerics;
using Velocity.Input;
using Velocity.Utils;

namespace Velocity;

struct DefaultSettings
{
    public const int Resolution = 0;
    public const bool FullScreen = false;
    public const double CameraLinearity = 0.95;
    public const double Volume = 1;
    public const double GameVolume = 1;
    public const double UiVolume = 1;
    public const double PlayerVolume = 1;
    public static readonly Keybinds Keybinds = new();
}

public class Settings : IEquatable<Settings>, ICloneable

    public static IniFile SettingsFile = new(Utils.Utils.CurrentDirectory + "settings.ini");

    public static readonly Vector2[] Resolutions =

    public void Load()

        }
        
        PopulateSettings();
    }

    private void PopulateSettings()
    {
        Resolution = Convert.ToInt32(SettingsFile.GetSetting("display", "resolution"));
        FullScreen = Convert.ToBoolean(SettingsFile.GetSetting("display", "fullscreen"));
        CameraLinearity = Convert.ToDouble(SettingsFile.GetSetting("display", "camera_linearity"));

    public bool Equals(Settings? other)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, other)) return false;

            Volume.Equals(other.Volume) &&
            GameVolume.Equals(other.GameVolume) &&
            UiVolume.Equals(other.UiVolume) && 
            PlayerVolume.Equals(other.PlayerVolume) &&
            Keybinds.Equals(other.Keybinds);
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, obj)) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) return true;
        if (obj.GetType() != this.GetType()) return false;
        return Equals((Settings)obj);
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine(CameraLinearity, Resolution, Keybinds, Volume, GameVolume, UiVolume, PlayerVolume, Keybinds);
    }

    public object Clone()
    {
        return MemberwiseClone();
    }
}
```

As you can see there is also some boilerplate code for the IClonable and IEquatable class declaration, this is so we can later compare and clone this class if we are trying to compare class differences.
This file saves all the settings to three sections, and it outputs and reads to a file called `settings.ini` in the root directory of the program files.
It looks something like this:
```ini
[SOUND]
PLAYER_VOLUME=1
UI_VOLUME=0.81
MASTER_VOLUME=0.89
GAME_VOLUME=1

[DISPLAY]
RESOLUTION=1
FULL_SCREEN=False
CAMERA_LINEARITY=0.95

[ROOT]
VELOCITY SETTINGS=

[CONTROLS]
JUMP=SPACE
INTERACT=S
LEFT=A
DOWN=DOWN
RIGHT=D
ZOOM_OUT=MINUS
ZOOM_IN=EQUAL
```

We now have a working settings class that saves to and reads from a file, we can test this and see it working as it outputs a file with the expected settings and results.

### Menus

Now that we have a working window opening and a settings menu, it would be good to have something to interact with on the screen so we can change our settings.
We need to do this by introducing a menu system for handling, the registration and handle for a menu class. It should keep track of all the menus and handle there open, currently open and close states accordingly and will close all menus when its close function is called.
We will create a subdirectory called `Ui` in our root folder and create a `MenuManager.cs` file and matching class. We will then define our functions with the procreate code to operate and define the actions mentioned above.
```csharp
using Velocity.Ui.Screens;

namespace Velocity.Ui;

public class MenuManager
{
    // Currently opened window
    private int CurrentWindow { get; set; }

    // Dictionary of all the registered window instances. - _windows[windowId] : Window
    private readonly Dictionary<int, Screens.Window> _windows = new ();

    // Run logic for current frame for currently active window.
    public void Tick()
    {
        if (!IsScreenActive()) return; // Do nothing if no window is active.
        _windows.TryGetValue(CurrentWindow, out Screens.Window? window); // Get the currently active window
        window?.Tick(); // Tick the found window if it exists.
    }

    // Register the default menus
    public void RegisterMenus()
    {
        RegisterMenu(SettingsScreen.UiId, new SettingsScreen());    // Register the pause screen
        RegisterMenu(MainMenuScreen.UiId, new MainMenuScreen());         // Register the main menu
        RegisterMenu(LevelScreen.UiId, new LevelScreen());          // Register the level selection screen
        RegisterMenu(PauseScreen.UiId, new PauseScreen());          // Register the pause screen
        RegisterMenu(WinScreen.UiId, new WinScreen());              // Register the win screen
        RegisterMenu(LoadingScreen.UiId, new LoadingScreen());      // Register the loading screen
    }

    // Register a menu
    private void RegisterMenu(int id, Screens.Window menu)
    {
        _windows.Add(id, menu); // Add the window to the dictionary
        
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.RegisterUiRenderer(menu.Renderer); // Register the respective window's renderer with the main renderer
    }
    

    // Set the active window to the argument provided, provide a calling menu for previous window step (e.g. settings > main menu, or settings > pause)
    public void SetActiveWindow(int id, int? previous = null)
    {
        DisableAll(); // Disable all windows
        CurrentWindow = id; // Set the current window id
        _windows.TryGetValue(CurrentWindow, out Screens.Window? window); // Get the newly selected window
        if (window == null) return; // Return if it doesnt exist (prevent type:null error)
        window.OnDisplay(previous); // Call the on-display function so the window knows its being opened
        Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.EnableRenderer(window.Renderer.Identifier); // Enable the respective window's renderer so its visible
    }

    // Disable all windows
    public void DisableAll()
    {
        foreach (var pair in _windows) // Iterative: step through all the registered windows and disable their renderer.
        {
            Loader.WindowManager.Renderer.DisableRenderer(pair.Value.Renderer.Identifier);
        }
        
        CurrentWindow = 0; // Set the current window to 0 (inactive state)
    }

    public bool IsScreenActive() // Checks to see if a screen is active by comparing current window to inactive state.
    {
        return CurrentWindow != 0;
    }
}
```

It is important to mention the declaration of this class in the main `Game` class as it is where this class is declared and utilised.
Calling the `MenuManager.Tick()` method in its tick function, therefor giving the menu a heart beat and enabling it to handle menus when they are needed.

Now as you can see this class references our windows we are going to create. These are referenced further down in this file.

## UI Elements

This subsection will be slightly different to the last as these belong in their own section.
The reason for this is because they are reused time and time again across the menus and will need explaining seperately.
Each subsection of this file will explain each ui element and its respective renderer. Starting with the base ui element

> #### `UiElement.cs`
> The base parent class for all the other elements to extend, contains basic code to calculate `IsMouseOver`, `IsClicked`, `GetValue`, `RegisterSubElements`(for labels and values), and `SetRenderer` for setting the renderer for that ui type.

## Windows

#### Main menu
Now that we have a working menu manager, and some ui elements to build our menus, its time to create some, we will be starting with the main menu.
For this we will need one element defined in the [UiElements](#ui-elements) subsection. A button, 3 of them to be precise. A play, settings and exit button.
