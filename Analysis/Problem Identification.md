# Problem Identification

In the 21st centery, we are ever more interconnected with eachother through technology.
However, many applications for communication are somewhat lackluster when it comes to features. Think about it, when have you ever seen a way to send games, money, gifts and more to eachother while also chatting about your favroute animals? No, you havent. No modern day application for communication has built in game sharing, or money gifting. This is what I want to achieve.

The features of the system that I would need would be, 2 servers, one hosting the "server" software for the backend, and a frontend webserver for the ui for the user. However it can be hard to get decent encription of all chats, so I want to impliment some end to end encryption.
