# Problem Identification

In the 21st century, we are ever more interconnected with each other through technology.
However, many applications for communication are somewhat lackluster when it comes to features. Think about it, when have you ever seen a way to send games, money, gifts and more to each other whilst chatting about your favorite animals? You haven't. No modern day application for communication has built in game sharing, or money gifting. This is what I want to achieve.

The features of the system that I would need would be, 2 servers, one hosting the "server" software for the backend, and a front end webserver for the ui for the user. However it can be hard to get decent encryption of all chats, so I want to implement some end to end encryption.
