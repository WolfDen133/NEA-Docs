# Problem Identification

In the world of gaming, where players seek thrilling adventures and immersive experiences, the creation of a 2D platformer game holds great promise. This genre captivates players with its dynamic gameplay, challenging obstacles, and pursuit mechanics that keep hearts pounding. Leveraging the computational power of modern technology, developers can bring to life a captivating world where players navigate through levels, evading the relentless pursuit of non-player characters. This computational solution allows for the seamless integration of visually stunning graphics, responsive controls, and intelligent artificial intelligence, offering an exhilarating gaming experience. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of developing a 2D platformer game, from understanding the stakeholders and the suitability of a computational solution, to breaking down the challenges, and finally, the abstraction required to create a captivating and well-balanced gaming experience. So, let's embark on this thrilling journey into the world of a 2D platformer game, where danger lurks around every corner and the pursuit never ends.

> ## Stakeholders
> The intended players for this game would be avid gamers who enjoy platformer games and are looking for a challenging and thrilling experience. The game will primarily target individuals who enjoy the excitement of running through levels and being pursued by non-player characters. However, the stakeholders would be the broader gaming community, as there are also players who would be interested in this type of 2D platformer game.
>
>To ensure accessibility, the game should be designed to cater to players of various skill levels and ages. Implementing adjustable difficulty settings would be ideal to accommodate both casual and hardcore gamers. Making the controls intuitive and user-friendly would also enhance the gaming experience for all players, regardless of their level of expertise.

> ## Why is it suited to a computational solution
> A computational solution is well-suited for creating a 2D platformer game because computers offer powerful processing capabilities, allowing for complex and dynamic gameplay mechanics. The ability to manipulate and render graphics in real-time, calculate physics interactions, and handle player input makes computers the ideal platform for developing and running a game of this nature.
> 
> Furthermore, a computational solution enables developers to implement sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms to control the non-player character's behavior, creating a challenging and engaging experience for players. The game can leverage the computational power of modern hardware to deliver smooth animations, realistic physics simulations, and immersive audiovisual effects.

> ## What a computational solution would lend
> > ### Problem recognition:
> > The challenge in creating a 2D platformer game with a pursuit dynamic lies in ensuring the gameplay remains exciting and balanced. This involves designing intricate levels, implementing responsive controls, and fine-tuning the behavior of the non-player character to provide an appropriate level of challenge without becoming frustratingly difficult.
>
> > ### Problem decomposition
> > Breaking down the problem into smaller steps helps address the main challenge:
> >
> > - Designing visually appealing and diverse levels that offer a balance between difficulty and enjoyment.
> > - Implementing smooth and responsive player controls to provide a satisfying platforming experience.
> > - Developing an intelligent and adaptive non-player character with pursuit mechanics that add tension and excitement to the gameplay.
> > - Incorporating checkpoints, power-ups, and collectibles to enhance replayability and strategic decision-making.
> > - By addressing these individual components, the overall challenge of creating an engaging and balanced 2D platformer game can be effectively tackled.

> ## All together now
> While each step presents its own unique challenges, integrating them harmoniously into a cohesive game experience requires careful consideration. Balancing level design, player controls, non-player character behavior, and additional gameplay elements is essential to ensure the game remains enjoyable and immersive.

> ## Abstraction
> In developing the game, focus should be placed on creating a robust underlying framework that allows for seamless gameplay mechanics. This includes handling player input, managing character animations, detecting collisions, and processing enemy behavior.
>
> Efficient data management is crucial for storing level data, player progress, and non-player character attributes. Implementing optimized algorithms and data structures will help deliver smooth performance and minimize processing overhead.
>
> Moreover, the game should be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of new levels, enemies, and gameplay features as the project evolves. By considering these factors and employing efficient computational techniques, the development of a captivating and challenging 2D platformer game can be realized.
