# Problem Identification

In the 21st century, we are ever more interconnected with each other through technology.
There are many applications and services dedicated to communication & social aspects of peoples lives. However, the vast majority of these are just that, and nothing more. This is the problem. Say for instance, a creator is working on a project with his or her team, and they make a few updates to there work; normally they would have to upload it to a file sharing/hosting service and then send a link back. But why not just have it in the same app? Or how about the gaming community, they want an easy way to send game credits, mods or even have a community drop box for shared files. They might even want to have there hosting service right at there fingertips. But I've never seen anything like that.

These days there is no easy way to manage all your communication needs right there. So why not? I believe that company's focus on one spastic suit or need, and focus all there efforts in providing that specific service in the best way they can, but they dont necessarily think about how they could link it to other services. Having a easy to use, application to bring all of your communication needs together and further integrate your services of choice, would be very beneficial to users who are actively using there technology, who don't want to be switching tabs all the time. To have a communication app with built in support would not only solve these problems, but it would serve its part in cooperate or educational needs, having all the users connected means all types of people can connect through the studies. Even teachers could use it.

### Stakeholders

The intended clients for this software would be frequent users of their computers. This is because the software will be a generalisation of all there most used software's, combined into one. The software will be largely communication based so it will be mostly targeted at people who communicate a lot using there technology.
However, the stake holders would be the general user base of the internet, there are also people that could want a solution like this for there educational or cooperate needs.

I want the software to be as easily accessible to all types of ranges, so implementing accessibility settings would be ideal for this software. Making it accessible to all types of ages would bring more people together, by there interests and hobbies, finding suggested servers or other users that occupy the same interests, rather than being brought together by the same age.
Any user that can operate a computer is intended to use this software, so making it as user friendly as possible will be the best option.

### Why is it suited to a computational solution

Well, computers are the most diverse machines we have on the planet, and all types of people use them all the time. Having a application that brings a large amount of functionality into one place, while also being a central hub for communication would suit a computational solution extremely well.

Simply put, there is no other way to do it. My app focuses on bringing all a users wants and needs together, an non-computational alternative doesnt exist. Controlling different aspects of services and communication apps can be clunky when clicking between different applications, but an easy to use app would be perfect.
