 # Research

## Existing similar solutions

> ### [Discord](https://discord.com/)
> [![Discord](https://i.imgur.com/NrDFX2I.png)](https://www.discord.com/)
> 
> #### Overview
> Starting us off is discord. I as a developer use discord a lot, for general communication, sharing code, freelance programming and more, so I thought it would be a good candidate to evaluate.
> Using the screenshot above we can see that the discord window is constructed of three main parts with an optional forth.
> At the top left, along the "Server Navigator" bar, there is a home button to take you to your overview, a create and search button for servers and the user's subscribed servers.
> To the right of that, there is the main nav, and friends list, with the users information, global microphone controls and settings icon.
> The nav portion has three buttons that take you to your friends page displayed on the content window that will be talked about later, a nitro screen for optional pearks for a small subscription fee, and a library section for games.
> Then there is the main window in the center that is usually for the main chat window of the current server/friend that you are talking to.
> Then the far right bar which is for displaying additional information about a current user/s or your friend's activities.
> 
> #### Ideas to adopt
> - I really admire the user oriented approach in the development of the appearance of discord, prioritising your friends from the home screen. I believe this will be valuable for my app because it symbolises how important relationships are between people. Showing my users that this one of my priories as a developer will ensure there trust in my app.
> - I also really would love to adopt the servers feature for users. The ability for users to create and manage there own servers puts a lot of responsibility and maturity in users. Users can make discord servers to represent anything they wish, so no matter how many servers there are, there will always be one to suit you.
> - I love there color scheme as well as the ability to be able to customise the appearance of discord. This is a good customisable as well as being a Accessibility setting, for visually impaired users. In-fact there entire accessibility settings page is really customisable and makes access arrangements one of the best parts of this app.
> - Discord is also cross compatible with most platforms, I would also like to adopt this.
> - Discords user system is also very good, with the use of Usernames and tags (a 4 digit code), so multiple users can have the same username if they wish, but they still have a way to uniquely identify each-other.
> - I also like discord nitro, which gives the users some perks, like custom themes, bigger upload sizes, custom emojis etc. If i can execute this well, it will be a really good way of generating revenue from my app.

> ### [Snapchat](https://snapchat.com/)
> [![Snapchat](https://i.imgur.com/o8Vyx1Z.png)](https://snapchat.com/)
> 
> #### Overview
> Secondly I want to evaluate snapchat. Snapchat is a mobile communication platform, that encourages users to send photos or 'snaps' to each-other, so that they dont have to communicate what there doing, they can just show there friends what there doing. Snapchat also has a text chat feature built in for text based communication. It also has group-chats for multiple users to communicate much like discord, but unlike discord, it has stories so that users can post a public snap to all there friends if they wish to view it.
> Snapchat also deletes messages after either depending on the users choice, after 24 hours or after the chat is left. With the optional feature of tapping on a message or attachment sent in chat to save it permanently. Snapchat's user system is more alike a traditional user system of having a username to identify each user, with them having to have a unique username, per user. It also has public stories, which are like public & sponsored posts for the whole world to see, with the addition of an infinite scroll snap viewer alike tiktok or instagram reels.
> Snapchat includes 'SnapMaps', which is a way for enabled users to locate each-other in real time, and has the ability to post to SnapMaps, so if users want to see random snaps from a certain place they can. The final thing I will go over is snapchat's payed subscriptions. Snapchat incorporates a feature called SnapChat+ which allows a lot more customisation features of the general apps appearance, along with some ability perks, such as restoring snap-streaks (how many days in a row that you & a specific user have snapped each-other), and various other things.
> 
> #### Ideas to adopt
> - I really like the snap orientated method of communication, allowing users to send pictures or videos to each-other, allowing for a deeper communication than just text, so the ability to easily send photos and videos to each-other will be a good feature in my app.
> - Group chat's are a really good way of including multiple people in different circumstances, and a good way for different types of users to connect, so I would like to incorporate this into my app. 
> - I also like the idea of confidentiality that there app offers, automatically deleting old messages and content if its not needed, however I will make this optional in my app. (This also helps out with server/db space :)).
> - And snapchat's + feature is a really clever adoption, while giving users more customisable, while giving payed users more features. The inventive is always there to buy it. I may want to adopt this into my app, however I want to keep the communication as fair as possible.
