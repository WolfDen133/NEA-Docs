 # Interviews and user data
 When creating a communication app, the number one thing to keep in mind is the user base. They are the people who will be using the application day in day out.
 Therefor there input is highly valuable.
> ### Questions 
>
> I will be asking a variety of questions related to features that I wish to include, and a few related to technology in general.
> 
> 1. How often do you use technology?
> 2. How often do you use apps that are used to communicate with others?
> 3. What & how many different methods of access do you use?
> 4. Would you want an easier way of managing all your related services, and why?
> 5. Would you like to meet other people based on there interests, and why?
> 6. Would you like to meet people of different ages based on your interests?
> 7. Would you want an unbiast way of connecting with people?
> 8. If provided the option for a small amount of money, would you support projects for perks?
> 9. If you had never heared of communication services, would you like the idea of a communication service that intigrates your non communication services?

> ### Client 1
> 
> - Subject: `Mateusz Burzynski`
> - Age: `16`
> - Occupation: `Unemployed`
> - Reasoning: `I want to interview Mati because he represents a perspective of having alot of time to spend on socials and related services, so he will provide a unbiast opinion`
> 1. `Quite often`
> 2. `Probably 40%`
> 3. `PC & Phone`
> 4. `It would be easier if it was all in one place`
> 5. `Probably yeah`
> 6. `Yeah probably, it would be easier if there my age`
> 7. `Yeah personally`
> 8. `F*** yeah mate`
> 9. `That would be pretty sick actually`
>
> > ### Evaluation
> >
> > From the initial ideas proposed, I can see that most are solid.
> > User clearly want to connect with other people in there age groups and common interests, with the suggested ideas of listing more than just hobby interests, but also list music, film interests and more to really suit people together.
> > These answers are really good for the development of my app, by reinforcing my initial idea, while adding there own suggestions.
> >
> > - Questions one, two and three identify that they use there technology quite often, and further use communication apps a large amount of time. With the addition of using two devices, enforcing the need for cross-compatibility.
> > - Three enforces that managing related services such as game hosting with game communication would be useful.
> > - Five and six helps me understand that people want to meet each-other based on there common interests, with the additive comment of using other subject interests. They want to meet people their age more than different ages so i will be using that going forward.
> > - Seven confirms that they dont want algorithms deciding there decisions of what they see, so they soley want to meet people based on there common interests.
> > - Eight tells me that people would like to support the project if provided a way, which can promote passive revenue
> > - And nine tells me that it would be easier and more convenient for the user if there different frequently used services are organised together.

> ### Client 2
> 
> - Subject: `Lochan Presley`
> - Age: `20`
> - Occupation: `Part time bar & shop work`
> - Reasoning: `I want to interview lochlan because he is an employed adult and I believe his answeres will aid in gaining a decent knolage how young adults would use my app`
> 
> 1. `About 70% of the time`
> 2. `Most of the time`
> 3. `Phone`
> 4. `Yes because it makes life easier, much more simple`
> 5. `Yes because it would be nice to meet other people`
> 6. `Yes in a range`
> 7. `Yes defonately`
> 8. `Yes take my money now`
> 9. `Yes defonately`
>
> > ### Evaluation
> >
> > Again, from the ideas proposed, I can see that most remain solid.
> > The user wants to meet and talk to people based on there interests within a given age range, while also reinforcing user one's point of listing other subject interests.
> > User 2 provides some really positive feedback on my ideas.
> >
> > - Questions one, two and three identify that they use there technology very often, and further use communication apps the majority of their time. Only uses a phone for communication but does use an XBox for gaming.
> > - Three enforces that managing related services would be useful because it would be much simpler and easier to have it together.
> > - Five and six reinforces user one's point that people want to meet each-other based on there common interests, with the additive comment of using other subject interests. And would want to only meet people within a given range.
> > - Seven further enforces that they dont want algorithms deciding what and who they see and meet.
> > - Eight tells me that people would gladly support the project, enforcing passive revenue.
> > - And nine backs up the point of client one's opinions of organising there services.
