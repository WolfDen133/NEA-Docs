# My Proposal

## My Initial Proposal Based on the Research:

My application will be a 2D side scroller/platformer game where players are pursued by an NPC throughout the levels. The game will incorporate elements inspired by games like Extreme Pamplona and Cuphead. Players will navigate through challenging levels, avoiding obstacles, and using various mechanics to escape from the relentless NPC chasing them. The game will provide a thrilling and intense gameplay experience.

The game will be developed using the raylib framework in C#. Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use game development library that provides powerful features for creating 2D games. It will allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive game with smooth animations and responsive controls.

For the backend, I will utilize C# to manage the game logic, including the NPC's behavior, level progression, and player interactions. The frontend will consist of the game's graphical user interface (GUI) and will be developed using raylib's rendering capabilities. This will enable us to create visually stunning levels, character animations, and special effects.

To ensure an immersive gaming experience, I will focus on creating dynamic sound effects and background music using raylib's audio capabilities. These audio elements will enhance the gameplay and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the game.

While the initial version of the game will be developed for desktop platforms, such as Windows, Mac, and Linux, we will explore the possibility of porting it to other platforms, including mobile devices, using raylib's multi-platform support.

> ### Limitations
>
> - The game will be limited to platforms supported by raylib and its dependencies.
> - Customizability options may be limited compared to more extensive game development frameworks.
> - Native integration with other services may require additional development efforts.

> ### Firther feedback from stake-holders 
> This is an email I wrote to my clients in the [interviews](Interviews.md).

> Dear Valued Clients,
>
> I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your interest in our upcoming game. Your feedback and support are invaluable to us as we work on developing and improving the platform.
> 
> Our goal is to create an exciting 2D side scroller/platformer game that provides a thrilling gameplay experience, inspired by games like Extreme Pamplona and Cuphead. The game will feature intense levels where players are chased by an NPC, requiring quick reflexes and strategic maneuvers to escape.
> 
> To bring this vision to life, we have chosen to develop the game using the raylib framework in C#. Raylib provides a powerful and user-friendly environment for creating visually appealing and interactive 2D games. With its capabilities, we can deliver smooth animations, responsive controls, and captivating visuals.
