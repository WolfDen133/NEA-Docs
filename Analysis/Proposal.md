 # My proposal

## My initial proposal from my given research:

My application will be a solution to my problem proposed in the analysis, an app that incorporates peoples various and related services in one place while also being peoples main communication service. 
It will be a web based app initially, but will try to incorporate dedicated app for each platform I can.
It will incorporate a backend for keeping a user database, and will have a front end built with asp.net for general service management. 
It will have a text based, audio based, and video based communication, while also being an easy way to pull all your info up anywhere you need.
The app will be called Communable.

> ### Limitations
> 
> - Incorporating native services, I will have to use web-view & iFrame for services
> - Limited application settings, given the time constraints and project complexity, I might not be able to incorperate as many customizability settings as other platforms. 
> - Native packets, my solution will probibly use web requests rather than native in-built packets.

> ### Firther feedback from stake-holders 
> This is an email I wrote to my clients in the [interviews](https://github.com/WolfDen133/NEA-Docs/blob/main/Analysis/Interviews.md).
> `Dear Valued Clients,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your interest in our upcoming app. Your feedback and support will be invaluable to us as we work on developing and improving the platform.

Our goal is to create a mainstream form of communication that integrates with your other online services, such as online shops and other social platforms. Our app will provide a seamless experience for all your communication needs.

As we work on developing the app, we are considering introducing a small paid subscription that will include some exclusive perks. However, I want to emphasize that the core features of the app will remain free for all users.

We would love to hear your feedback and any ideas you may have for the project. Your input is crucial to us as we strive to create the best possible experience for our users.

Thank you again for your support and interest. We look forward to continuing to work with you.

Best regards,

Reuben Yates, Communable CEO.`
