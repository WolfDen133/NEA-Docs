# My proposal

## My initial proposal from my given research:

My application will be a solution to my problem proposed in the analysis, an app that incorporates peoples various and related services in one place while also being peoples main communication service. 
It will be a web based app initially, but will try to incorporate dedicated app for each platform I can.
It will incorporate a backend for keeping a user database, and will have a front end built with asp.net for general service management. 
It will have a text based, audio based, and video based communication, while also being an easy way to pull all your info up anywhere you need.

> ### Limitations
> 
> - Incorporating native services, I will have to use web-view & iFrame for services
> - Limited application settings, given the time constraints and project complexity, I might not be able to incorperate as many customizability settings as other platforms. 
> - Native packets, my solution will probibly use web requests rather than native in-built packets.
