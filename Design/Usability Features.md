A clear usability feature is that it needs to be playable by any age of user, including interacting with the game, so I feel it is important to add clear user controls where necessary to guide the user in how to play the game.

Any text needs to be readable on the screen at any size so will aim to adapt different screen resolutions, and all game elements should be thoroughly visible at any scale.

As you can see from this mockup, the text will appear large in the buttons and will span 5 elements in the window height so everything is visible.

Playability is also important down to knowing what controls to use, so the bottom of the screen will show where the player controls will be.

I want to focus on the ability to navigate the levels easily, maybe introducing a level select carousel with screenshots of the levels to display what a level will be, including the level difficulty.

I want to also make it clear if the game is loading or saving to make sure that the user doesnt have to wait for program hangs and so they don't get confused between crashes and intended behaviour.

Having clear explanations for in game features will also be an important factor as some new players, not just to the game, but the gaming industry need to be able to understand game mechanics, controls, scoring schemes etc.
