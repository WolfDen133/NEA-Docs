These are the designs of the main menu and settings screens I want to implement. I will first mark them out with rectangles in the game engine and then add assets and textures later.

> #### Firstly the main menu screen
> - It will consists of a section for the title card where there will be a banner for the game, including its title. It will be positioned at the top left of the screen
> - Next there is the buttons area. There will be a play button that will take the player to the [Level select screen](Level select.md). There will also be a button to take the user to the [Player stats screen](Player stats.md). Then there will be a button to take the user to the settings menu, and lastly a quit button.
> - The background section is where there will be animated transition images of the game, to keep the player engaged with the game straight from boot.
